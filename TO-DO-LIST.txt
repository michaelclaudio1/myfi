TO DO LIST:
 - Incorporate Plaid
 - update the wizard page to incorporate Plaid
 - store Plaid information somehow, then generate financial data once user is logged in.

BUG LIST: 
 - Sign out not currently redirecting to the sign-in page
 - Fix light mode CSS (just doesn't look good, probably an easy way to do this with Tailwind)
 - some issues with adding something new (an income or expense) and reloading the page to immediately show the addition
    - It appears that the issue is only when something new (an income or expense) is added for today, any other time it works correctly
    - This also won't be a bug once Plaid is implemented, as this functionality will not exist.
 - scrolling the page when a modal is open

WISH LIST:
  * This is a list of features/changes/implementations that I would like to add. Not critical to functionality,
  * but would enhance UX.
 - Root opening page, where users don't have to be signed in to see what the website is about
 - Automatically change DBs when working locally or on production
